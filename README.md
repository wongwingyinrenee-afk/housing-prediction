# Housing-Prediction: Data-Driven Insights for Real Estate

This project analyzes over 200,000 real estate transaction records to predict customer home purchase intentions. Leveraging Python and scikit-learn, I performed extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. Multiple machine learning models—including Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Random Forest—were evaluated to identify the key drivers of property purchases and optimize predictive performance.

Key outcomes include uncovering the most influential features affecting buying decisions, addressing data leakage risks, and delivering actionable recommendations for property agents to refine client targeting and sales strategies.

**Core skills demonstrated:**  
- Data preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Feature engineering  
- Model selection & evaluation  
- Business insights communication

Predicts customer home purchase decisions using Python and machine learning models (Logistic Regression, MLP, Random Forest) with real estate features and 200,000 records. Provides actionable insights for agents to improve property recommendations and sales strategies

This project analyzes over 200,000 real estate transaction records to predict customer home purchase decisions. It leverages Python for data preprocessing and builds multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, MLP, and random forest. Feature engineering addresses potential data leakage, and model evaluation guides actionable strategy for property agents.
Key skills: Data cleansing, feature analysis, model comparison, business insight extraction.
